# cron info:
# Input consists of six fields, separated by blanks.
# The first five give a date and time in the following form:
# 1. m - minute, expressed as a number from 0 through 59.
# 2. h - hour, expressed as a number from 0 through 23.
# 3. D - day of the month, expressed as a number from 1 through 31.
# 4. M - month of the year, expressed as a number from 1 through 12.
# 5. WD - day of the week, expressed as a number from 0 through 6 (with 0 standing for Sunday).
# Any of these fields may contain an asterisk * standing for all possible values.
# For example, if you have an * as the day of the month, the job runs every day of the month.
# A field can also contain a set of numbers separated by commas, or a range of numbers, with the
# first number followed by a minus sign - followed by the second number.
# If you give specific days for both day of the month and day of the week, the two are OR'ed together.
# examples:
# 1 2 3 4 5
# m h D M WD
# 0 0 * * * -- midnight every day
# 0 0 * * 1-5 -- midnight every weekday
# 0 0 1,15 * * -- midnight on 1st and 15th of month
# 0 0 1 * 5 -- midnight on 1st of month and every Friday
# The sixth field of a crontab entry is a string that your shell executes at the specified time.
